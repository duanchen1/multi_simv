# multi_simv
A communication framework utilizing sockets and DPI (Direct Programming Interface) to interconnect multiple testbenches. This approach aims to accelerate simulation speeds and facilitate SoC (System-on-Chip) simulations. While conceptually similar to the distributed simulation feature (dist_sim) introduced in VCS 2023.
